# Topic modeling using LDA and R

In natural language processing, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar.

This dashboard contains:
  - data exploration (training data with assigned topic probabilities) <sup>[1](#foot1)</sup>
  - information of hyperparams as well as perplexity plot with information of an optimal number of topics
  - top 10 high word frequency graph for each topic <sup>[1](#foot1)</sup>
  - LDAvis <sup>[1](#foot1)</sup>
  - topic distributions over time as well as topic proportions over time <sup>[1](#foot1)</sup>
  - WordClouds which show us words that are strongly associated with each topic <sup>[1](#foot1)</sup>
  - check text [experimental], give the user to put input text and see which topic given text belongs <sup>[1](#foot1)</sup>

<a name="foot1">[1]</a>: User can choose a variable number of topics (limited to trained ones)

Feel free to explore all. I hope you will find something interesting.
